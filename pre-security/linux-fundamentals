## üß∞ Basic Linux Commands

### üìÇ Navigation
```bash
pwd               # Print working directory
ls                # List directory contents
cd /path/to/dir   # Change directory
clear             # Clear the terminal

touch file.txt         # Create a new file
cat file.txt           # Display file content
nano file.txt          # Edit file with Nano editor
mv old new             # Rename or move file/directory
cp file1 file2         # Copy a file
rm file.txt            # Delete a file

mkdir myfolder         # Make a directory
rmdir myfolder         # Remove empty directory
rm -r myfolder         # Remove directory and its contents

find / -name "file.txt"         # Search entire system for a file
grep "keyword" file.txt         # Search for a word inside a file

Important Concepts

Case-sensitive OS: File.txt ‚â† file.txt
Command chaining: Use &&, ;, and || to link commands
Wildcards: * for multiple matches, e.g., *.txt
Tab completion: Speeds up typing and avoids errors
