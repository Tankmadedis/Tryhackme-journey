## üåê Key Concepts

- **Network:**  
  A group of two or more devices connected to share resources or information.

- **IP Address:**  
  A unique identifier for a device on a network.  
  Example: `192.168.1.1`

- **MAC Address:**  
  Hardware address permanently assigned to a device's network card.

- **Ports:**  
  Virtual endpoints for communication.  
  Example: HTTP = port `80`, HTTPS = port `443`

## üß© IP Address Types

| Type             | Description                          | Example             |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------|
| IPv4             | Most common, 32-bit (e.g. 192.168.0.1) | 192.168.1.1         |
| IPv6             | Newer, 128-bit, more address space     | fe80::1ff:fe23:4567:890a |
| Public IP        | Routable on the internet              | 8.8.8.8             |
| Private IP       | Used in local networks only           | 192.168.0.1         |
| Loopback         | Refers to the same machine            | 127.0.0.1           |

## üì¶ Protocols You Should Know

| Protocol | Purpose                     | Port |
|----------|-----------------------------|------|
| HTTP     | Web traffic (unsecured)     | 80   |
| HTTPS    | Web traffic (secured)       | 443  |
| FTP      | File Transfer               | 21   |
| SSH      | Secure Shell access         | 22   |
| DNS      | Domain Name Resolution      | 53   |
| DHCP     | Dynamic IP assignment       | 67/68|
| ICMP     | Ping/troubleshooting        | n/a  |

## üîê DNS Explained

- DNS = "Phonebook of the internet"
- Converts domain names (e.g. `google.com`) into IP addresses.
- Common commands:
  - `nslookup domain.com`
  - `dig domain.com`

---

## üï∏Ô∏è Network Devices

- **Router:** Connects multiple networks and routes traffic.
- **Switch:** Connects devices within a network; smarter than a hub.
- **Firewall:** Monitors and controls network traffic.
- **Access Point:** Provides wireless access to a network.

---

## üß∞ TryHackMe Tools Introduced

- **ipconfig / ifconfig:** View IP configuration
- **ping:** Check if host is reachable
- **tracert / traceroute:** Show path to destination
- **nslookup / dig:** DNS lookups
- **netstat:** View active connections

---

## üí° Key Takeaways

- Understanding how data travels over networks is critical in cybersecurity.
- IP, MAC, and ports are the foundation of system identification and communication.
- DNS is a common target for attackers (e.g., DNS spoofing).
- Simple commands reveal valuable information in both offensive and defensive roles.
